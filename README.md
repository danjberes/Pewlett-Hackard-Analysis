# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use databases and SQL queries to determine the number of employees that are due for retirement at Pewlett-Hackard. In addition an additional table will be created to determine which employees are available for the mentoship program to replace the retirement candidates.

## Results/Findings

1) An incredibly large amount employees at the company are ready to retire
	* 90398 employees are eligible for retirement
	* That would be 38% of the company's employees if they all took their retirement
	
2) The majority of the retiring positions would be Senior Staff meaning a severe reduction in overall employee expertise

3) Comparatively, a very small amount of employees would be eligible for the mentorship program
	* 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program
	
4) Only two of the staff that are eligible for retirement are managers

## Summary

To fill this "Silver Tsunami" of eligible retirees, 90398 positions would need to be filled. This would require an extensive hiring process due to the low amount of mentors available. Only 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program which would not be enough to cover the extensive amount of positions that are likely to become vacant in the near future.
